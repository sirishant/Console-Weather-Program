Created for 3rd Semester CSE "Object Oriented Programming using Java" Course Project.
Uses various head-scratch inducing concepts like API call and conversion of JSON to a Map using Google Gson.
It also involves conversion of a JSON to ArrayList for an Object-as-Array json.

Handles HTTP Exceptions. Does not have a front-end yet. Maybe SoonTM?
